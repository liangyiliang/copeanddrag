## Card Dealing

- Up to 3 cards per person
- Dealing happens clockwise (ie starting at the dealer's left)
- Dealer is impartial (so gets no cards, does not play)
- Everyone gets one card per dealing round (everyone is dealt one card, then another, then another).

### Questions

- Who will be dealt the next card?
- How many cards does the person across the table from the dealer have?
