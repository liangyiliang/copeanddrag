# Diplomatic Protocol

- Everyone must be seated in alternating order (Hosts , Visitors)

- Only the person with the mic can speak, and is allotted 1 minute for remarks. The mic is passed clockwise along the table.

Questions:

- Is protocol violated here or no?
- If `X` is is about to begin speaking, how long will it take for `Y` to get their chance to speak.
