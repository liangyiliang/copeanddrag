# Study 1

- To be deployed on Prolofic
- Examples should not be related to computer science, but have broader appeal.

- Purpose: Formative, helps determine if lightweight diagrams are more easily 'grok'-able than Sterling output.


## SK

- Lets say this is the final study. Need to justify why these N things (let's focus on what we chose in the tool, etc).
- What is the justification? Expect: These are the principle components of our space. This example uses this, this example uses this (direction, grouping, curvature). Each does X. Indexing, etc, etc?

- Think about what you would gain or lose for each.

### Purpose: iterating to justify the design of the toolkit. Both experiential and from the literature. 


### Last step: People can use the toolkit.
