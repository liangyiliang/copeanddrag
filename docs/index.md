# Cope and Drag

CnD is a lightweight diagramming language designed for use with Alloy-like languages.
Diagrams are built by refining default Alloy output, rather than requiring users to build 
visualizations from scratch. 
This approach lets you get started quickly! Every well formed CnD spec
(*even an empty spec*) produces a diagram. This is achieved via two kinds of operations:

- [Constraints](constraints.md)
- [Directives](directives.md)

----

- [Syntax](syntax.md)
- [Examples](examples.md)
